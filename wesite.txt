# Gunfire on School Grounds Dashboard

**Overview**
This **Streamlit** dashboard provides a comprehensive, real-time analysis of gun violence incidents on school grounds across the United States. By automatically fetching and processing data from **Everytown Research**, the dashboard reveals critical patterns such as **84.1% of incidents occurring during school months** and **82.3% happening on weekdays**. With 1,465+ incidents analyzed across all 50 states, this tool transforms complex data into actionable insights for policymakers, educators, researchers, and communities working to prevent these tragedies.

**Important Note**: All statistics are dynamic and update with each dashboard access as new incidents are added to the source database. Numbers shown reflect real-time data pulls.

**Key Insights Discovered**
Through analysis of 1,528 total casualties (476 killed, 1,052 wounded):
- School calendar correlation: 84.1% during school months vs 15.9% summer (expected 25%)
- Geographic inequality: Gini coefficient of 0.486 indicates significant state-level concentration
- Severity paradox: 3.3% mass casualty events account for disproportionate 24.6% of casualties
- Intent patterns: "Attack on others" (744 incidents) shows 28.1% fatality rate
- Peak risk periods: October, September, January identified through temporal analysis
